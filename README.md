ML Studies / Assignment 2
Employee Data Analysis and Preprocessing
Project Overview
This project focuses on cleaning, analyzing, and preprocessing employee data to prepare it for machine learning applications. The dataset contains information about employees from various IT companies in India, including their age, salary, location, and gender.

Key Features
Data Exploration: Examines dataset structure, unique values, and statistical properties

Data Cleaning: Handles missing values, duplicates, outliers, and inconsistent formatting

Data Analysis: Filters specific employee segments and visualizes key relationships

Data Encoding: Transforms categorical variables into numerical representations

Feature Scaling: Standardizes numerical features using StandardScaler and MinMaxScaler

Requirements
Python 3.x

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

scikit-learn

Usage
Clone the repository

Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Jupyter notebook: notebooks/Employee_Data_Analysis.ipynb

Alternatively, use the preprocessing script: scripts/data_preprocessing.py

Results
The project produces:

Cleaned and preprocessed dataset ready for machine learning

Visualizations of key data relationships

Scaled feature versions for different modeling needs
